# function that dumps a compare copy of the db to diff for any changes I didnt make
# I worked out which tables to exclude by saving a diff result and opening it linewise
# Note the lack of '' on the EOT below, means its a heredoc, variables are expanded locally
#		hence the need to escape the $s on $thisOrLast - both are run on the server not client
#		why? Chiefly to avoid sending the password as a variable....

# So, in effect, escaping the $ in these vars is a way to run variables on a remote machine in a heredoc,
#		and in a moment we'll see how to do the opposite: run commands locally when we are essentially sending a nowdoc

# same idea here, this function gets made locally with the locally stored password variable, then gets used in the script.

# define a set of ssh commands, including a main nowdoc, to run an SQL compare and export over SSH

#				and call the variables as you would function calls
#				Note how I have to include the variable in the ssh call
#				THEN call the function that lies within it in the nowdoc.
